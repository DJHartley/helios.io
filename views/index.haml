  :markdown
    Helios is an open-source framework that provides essential backend services for iOS apps, from data synchronization and user accounts to push notifications, in-app purchases, and passbook integration. It allows developers to get a client-server app up-and-running in just a few minutes, and seamlessly incorporate functionality as necessary.

  %img#rocket{src: "/images/rocket.png", alt: "3...2...1... Blastoff!", width: "260", height: "270"}

  .step-1
    :markdown
      ## Install Heroku Toolbelt
      [Install the Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com), and you'll have everything you need to deploy your Helios application to Heroku, including Git and the heroku terminal command.

  .step-2
    :markdown
      ## Create an App
      In your Helios app directory, do `$ heroku create app-name` (or tempt fate by letting Heroku generate a name for you).

  .step-3
    :markdown
      ## 3...2...1... Blastoff!
      All that's left to do is a
      `$ git push heroku master`
      In almost no time at all, your app will be online and operational.

%section#client
  :markdown
    # Client Integration

    Of course, that's just the server half of the equation. The following iOS client libraries make it easy to integrate with Helios.
